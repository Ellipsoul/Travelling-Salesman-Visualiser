      <p id="tsp-explanation"> The travelling salesman problem is a very simple problem to explain, but an <i> extremely </i> difficult problem to solve efficiently. In computer science, this problem is classified as an <i> NP-Hard</i> problem, meaning that it cannot be solved in polynomial time or better, and a potentially optimal route cannot be verified as optimal in polynomial time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="tsp-explanation-list"> A traveller has several cities (<b>nodes</b>/<b>vertices</b>) he/she would like to visit.</li>
        <li class="tsp-explanation-list"> The traveller must visit all nodes exactly once and return to the original node (this is known as a <b>Hamiltonian Cycle</b>), and the goal is to find the path that <i>minimises</i> the traveller's total distance travelled.</li>
        <li class="tsp-explanation-list"> That's it! From vehicle routing to planning and logistics, the applications for this problem are endless! </li>
